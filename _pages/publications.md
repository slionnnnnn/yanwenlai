**_University of Florida_**              &emsp;     &emsp;                      *_Supervisor: Prof. Shuo Wang_*
 
*  **EMI modeling and reduction of traction inverter for electrical vehicle**  &emsp;  -Supported by Ford Motor Company
  
*  **Modeling and reduction for near magnetic field emission of passive magnetic components**  &emsp;  -Support by NSF
  
  Investigate the near magnetic field emission of the inductor, propose a novel common-mode inductor structure for EMI noise reduction, immunity against external magnetic interference and DM performance improvement
  
*  **EMI models development for non-isolated converters for EV based on CISPR 25**   &emsp;  -Supported by Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.
  
&emsp; 1)  Radiated EMI modeling of high-density DC-DC converters.

&emsp; 2)  Development of prediction model for both conducted EMI and radiated EMI based on circuit simulation and electromagnetic 3D full wave simulation.

&emsp; 3)  Investigation of the monopole antennaâ€™s mechanism in measurement and mismatch between the prediction and the measurement due to test setup.
