Education
======
* Ph.D. in Electrical&Computer Engineering, University of Florida, USA 2020-Present
* Master of Science, University of Florida, USA 2016-2018
* B.S in Electrical Engineering and Automation, South China University of Technology, P.R.China 2012-2016 

Research Experiences
======
* Investigate the near magnetic field emission of the inductor, propose a novel inductor structure for conducted EMI noise reduction, immunity against external magnetic interference and near magnetic field reduction.  
* Investigate the impact of mutual couplings between EMI filters and transformer on EMI based on power adapter.  
* Investigate the instability issue of a common mode active EMI filter for an EV on-board charger based on analysis and modeling.  
* Investigate and predict the low-frequency radiated EMI of a non-isolated power converter for electric vehicle based on analysis and modeling.
* Investigate the monopole antennaâ€™s mechanism in measurement and mismatch between the prediction and the measurement in the high-frequency region due to test setup.
