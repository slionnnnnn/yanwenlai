I am currently a  PhD candidate in Electrical&Computer Engineering at the University of Florida supervised by [Prof. Shuo Wang](https://peeprlgator.github.io/Shuo.Wang/index.html).  
During my PhD study, I worked closely with [Zheng Luo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zheng-luo-39b7b239/) at Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. on EV products (DC/DC power converters, magnetic components, etc.).  
I received the B.Sc. degree from South China University of Technology, China, in 2016, the M.Sc. degree from University of Florida, Gainesville, FL in 2018.
